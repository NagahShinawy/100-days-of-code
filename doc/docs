1- local scope is withing functions
2- there is no block scope

# ###########################

There are 2 of SCOPES
    1- block scope: you can access variables within (if, while, for)
    2- function scope: variable within function (you can use LOCAL, GLOBAL variable like we used in "scope.py"

SyntaxError: name 'bonus' is assigned to before global declaration

def update_salary_global_scope():
    global salary
    bonus = 0
    global bonus
    bonus += 5
    salary = 8000
    print("Salary Within Function", salary)
    print("inside", bonus)


# error: because now confused between local var, global var,!! . you tell python to take care about var that is local
and global in the same time.

# Type error: You trying do something with wrong data type

Procedural Programming: Just like coffee machine day 15 (using functions)

OOP: try to model real world obj (what obj has" attr", what obj does" methods")
- method: is not floating function, it is attached to a model (obj).

=====================

PascalCase, camelCase, snake_case,  capap-case

IMPORTING

- import turtle
- from turtle import Turtle
- from turtle import *

- import turtle as tut
- from turtle import Turtle as tim


===============================
higher order function: is function can work with another function

A function is called Higher Order Function if it contains other functions as a parameter or returns a function as an output
i.e, the functions that operate with another function are known as Higher order Functions
